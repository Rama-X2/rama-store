git commit -m "MOBILE PERFORMANCE: Major lag reduction optimization

Key optimizations implemented:
- Virtual scrolling for payment methods and packages
- Hardware acceleration with CSS containment
- Reduced animation durations for mobile (0.15s)
- Debounced input handlers (300ms)
- Throttled scroll events (16ms/60fps)
- Performance monitoring hooks
- Touch optimization utilities
- Viewport optimization
- Memory cleanup hooks
- Lazy loading with intersection observer
- CSS performance mode for low FPS devices
- Optimized framer-motion configurations
- Reduced backdrop blur on mobile
- GPU acceleration for transforms
- Memoized payment method data
- Virtualized components for large lists
- Custom viewport units for mobile
- Disabled expensive effects on mobile
- Optimized scroll behavior
- Reduced DOM complexity
- Improved touch interactions

Files modified:
- components/GameDetail.tsx (main optimization)
- app/globals.css (CSS performance tweaks)
- lib/mobile-performance.ts (utility functions)
- lib/performance-hooks.ts (React hooks)
- components/VirtualizedComponents.tsx (virtualized components)

Expected improvements:
- Significantly reduced scroll lag on mobile
- Faster animations and transitions
- Better touch responsiveness
- Reduced memory usage
- Improved FPS on low-end devices
- Smoother user interactions"
